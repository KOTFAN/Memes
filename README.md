# Memes

A high-quality collection of memes about **development**

If you’ve ever screamed at a merge conflict, renamed a file 5 times (`final_final_REAL_final.css`), or sacrificed your sanity to the CSS gods — you’re in the right place.

This repo includes:
- Dev pain, served fresh
- Git horrors, cursed commits
- Code that runs but shouldn’t
- Memes that hit harder than a failed deploy on Friday

> ⚠️ Warning: These memes contain 100% pure developer energy. Handle with caffeine.

Contribute if you dare. Laugh or cry — we don't judge.
