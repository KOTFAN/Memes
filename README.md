# 🧙‍♂️ dev-memes

A sacred archive of developer memes — collected not just for laughs, but for mental survival.  
No more scrolling endless feeds. No more digging through group chats. The memes are here, version-controlled, and ready to deploy directly into your soul.

This repo exists for one reason:  
⚠️ Because some days, the only thing standing between you and rage-quitting is a well-timed meme about `useEffect`.

👇 Inside you’ll find:
- Memes about frontend, backend, fullstack, and full-broke  
- Jokes about Git, npm, and that one guy who force-pushes to `main`  
- TypeScript pain, React drama, and CSS breakdowns  
- And much more...

💬 Contributions welcome. Drop your memes like hotfixes — fast, funny, and with questionable test coverage.
